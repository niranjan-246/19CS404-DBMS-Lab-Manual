# Experiment 3: DML Commands

## AIM
To study and implement DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.

## THEORY

### 1. INSERT INTO
Used to add records into a relation.
These are three type of INSERT INTO queries which are as
A)Inserting a single record
**Syntax (Single Row):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);
```
**Syntax (Multiple Rows):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES
(value_1, value_2, ...),
(value_3, value_4, ...);
```
**Syntax (Insert from another table):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE condition;
```
### 2. UPDATE
Used to modify records in a relation.
Syntax:
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
### 3. DELETE
Used to delete records from a relation.
**Syntax (All rows):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
**Syntax (Specific condition):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### 4. SELECT
Used to retrieve records from a table.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

**Question 1**
--
Update the total selling price to quantity sold multiplied by updated selling price per unit where product id is 10 in the sales table.

SALES TABLE
name               type
-----------------  ---------------
sale_id            INT
sale_date          DATE
product_id         INT
quantity           INT
sell_price         DECIMAL(10,2)
total_sell_price   DECIMAL(10,2)

```sql
update sales
set total_sell_price = quantity * sell_price
where product_id = 10
```

quantity           INT
supplier_id        INT

```sql
update products
set reorder_lvl = reorder_lvl * 0.7
where product_name like '%cream%' and quantity > reorder_lvl;
```
